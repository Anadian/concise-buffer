# Background
I created this module simply because I was tired of Node Buffer's default serialisation producing massive garish noise in my logs. This module is incredibly simple: right now, it defines a single exported function, `getStringFromBuffer`, which turns an entire buffer into a nicely readable and consistent format `Buffer:[ <some_bytes> ... <some_bytes> ]`; how many bytes it includes can be specified and defaults to 16. If the number of bytes requested is greater than half the length of the buffer: it will simply serialise the whole buffer in hexadecimal.
# Install
To use it as a dependency in another package run:
```sh
npm install --save concise-buffer
```
To install it globally run:
```sh
npm install --global concise-buffer
```
# Usage
Example:
```js
const ConciseBuffer = require('concise-buffer');

const some_buffer = Buffer.from( [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ] ); //In real use cases, the buffer will propbably be a lot longer than this but you get the idea.

var concise_string = ConciseBuffer.getStringFromBuffer( some_buffer, 4 ); //You can optionally specify how many bytes from the beginning and end of the buffer you want; the default is 16.

console.log( concise_string ); //Will print: `Buffer:[ 00010203 ... 0c0d0e0f ]`
